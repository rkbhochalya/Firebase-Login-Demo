# Firebase Login Demo

This is a [minimal, reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) for sign-in link [issue](https://github.com/invertase/react-native-firebase/issues/4976) on iOS Gmail app.

[`master`](https://github.com/rkbhochalya/Firebase-Login-Demo) branch has a working example with Google-provided domain (firebaselogindemo.page.link) being used in "sign-in with email" links.

[`custom-dynamic-links-domain`](https://github.com/rkbhochalya/Firebase-Login-Demo/tree/custom-dynamic-links-domain) branch uses a custom domain (firebaselogindemo.rkb.io) for sign-in links. Sign-in links generated using this domain doesn't get recognized as dynamic links when opened from Gmail app on iOS.
